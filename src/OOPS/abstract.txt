Sometimes you will want to create a superclass that only defines a generalized form that will be shared by all of its
subclasses, leaving it to each subclass to fill in the details. Such a class determines the nature of the methods that
the subclasses must implement.
You may have methods that must be overridden by the subclass in order for the subclass to have any meaning.
In this case, you want some way to ensure that a subclass does, indeed, override all necessary methods. Java’s solution
to this problem is the abstract method.
You can require that certain methods be overridden by subclasses by specifying the abstract type modifier.

        abstract type name(parameter-list);

These methods are sometimes referred to as subclass's responsibility because they have no implementation specified in
the superclass.
Thus, a subclass must override them—it cannot simply use the version defined in the superclass.

Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared abstract.
# There can be no objects of an abstract class.
# You cannot declare abstract constructors, or abstract static methods.
# You can declare static methods in abstract class.
Because there can be no objects for abstract class. If they had allowed to call abstract static methods,
it would that mean we are calling an empty method (abstract) through classname because it is static.
Any subclass of an abstract class must either implement all of the abstract methods in the superclass,
or be declared abstract itself.
Abstract classes can include as much implementation as they see fit i.e.there can be concrete methods(methods with body)
in abstract class.

Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to create object references,
because Java’s approach to run-time polymorphism is implemented through the use of superclass references.

A public constructor on an abstract class doesn't make any sense because you can't instantiate an abstract class directly
(can only instantiate through a derived type that itself is not marked as abstract)

Abstract class vs Interface:

Type of methods:
Interface can have only abstract methods.
Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.

Final Variables:
Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final.
An abstract class may contain non-final variables.

Type of variables:
Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
Interface has only static and final variables.

Implementation:
Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
Interface can’t provide the implementation of abstract class.

Inheritance vs Abstraction:
A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements”
and abstract class can be extended using keyword “extends”.

Multiple implementation:
An interface can extend another Java interface only,
an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.

Accessibility of Data Members:
Members of a Java interface are public by default.
A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.

OOPS

ABSTRACTION:
Abstraction is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features or behaviors. This helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency by focusing on "what an object does" rather than "how it does it."

Real-Life Examples of Abstraction:
1.	Car:
o	What you see: Steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, etc.
o	What is hidden: Complex mechanisms like the engine, fuel injection, braking system, etc.
2.	ATM Machine:
o	What you see: Options to withdraw money, check balance, etc.
o	What is hidden: The process of connecting to the bank server, verifying your PIN, fetching account details, etc.
3.	Example of Abstraction Using Abstract Class:
4.	java
5.	Copy code
6.	abstract class Animal {
7.	    // Abstract method (no implementation)
8.	    abstract void sound();
9.
10.	    // Concrete method (with implementation)
11.	    void eat() {
12.	        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
13.	    }
14.	}
15.
16.	class Dog extends Animal {
17.	    // Providing implementation for the abstract method
18.	    @Override
19.	    void sound() {
20.	        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
21.	    }
22.	}
23.
24.	public class Main {
25.	    public static void main(String[] args) {
26.	        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Upcasting
27.	        myDog.sound(); // The dog barks.
28.	        myDog.eat();   // This animal eats food.
29.	    }
30.	}


Example of Abstraction Using Interface:
java
Copy code
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }
    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car is stopping...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        myCar.start(); // Car is starting...
        myCar.stop();  // Car is stopping...
    }
}
